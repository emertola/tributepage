          <p>He was an English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst and theoretical biologist. He was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.</p>
          <br>
          <p>
          <h4>Some notable contributions:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>His first major work was On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungs problem, completed in 1936. The paper was the birth of what are now called Turing machines, symbol manipulating devices that can be adapted to simulate the logic of any algorithm, no matter how complex.</li>
              <li>From 1939 through 1940, Turing invented the electromechanical machine called the Bombe, which was designed to break Enigma faster. By the end of the war, over 200 Bombes were in operation. With the Bombe, the US Navy was able to decipher messages from enemy U-boats much faster, giving the US victory in many battles, including the Battle of the Atlantic.</li>
              <li>He significantly advanced the field of artificial intelligence, a phrase that hadn't even been coined until after his death. In a time when the first general purpose computers had just been built, Turing was already asking the question 'can computers think'?</li>
            </ul>
